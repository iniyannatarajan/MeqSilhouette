Integration with pipelines
==========================

MeqSilhouette can be used in tandem with other radio astronomy simulation/calibration software packages in software pipelines for data synthesis/reduction/analysis.

The *SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays* (`SYMBA <https://bitbucket.org/M_Janssen/symba/>`_) 
pipeline (`Roelofs et al., 2020 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A...5R/abstract>`_) uses MeqSilhouette
for synthetic data generation for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
