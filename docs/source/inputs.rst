.. _sky-models:

Sky models
##########
The parameter *input_fitsimage* points to sky models in one of three formats that are recognisable by MeqSilhouette.

FITS format
-----------
Sky models in FITS format are forward-modelled using *WSClean* under the hood. The directory pointed to by *input_fitsimage* must contain all FITS files that constitute the sky model, named according to the following convention:

* If there is no time-variability or polarisation, then *input_fitsimage* contains only one FITS image named *t0000-model.fits*.

* If the sky model is time-variable, the FITS files named *txxxx-model.fits*, where xxxx=0000, 0001, ... . The total number of unique times in the MS are divided evenly into N groups, where N is the number of times for which FITS files are present.

* If the sky model is polarised, the FITS images are named *txxxx-[IQUV]-model.fits*, representing each Stokes component [I, Q, U, V]. All Stokes components must be present for each time and frequency.

* If the sky model is frequency-variable, the FITS files are named *t0000-yyyy-model.fits*, where yyyy=0000, 0001, ... . The number of frequencies must be equal to *input_changroups*.

Following *WSClean*, MeqSilhouette does not care about the actual frequencies in the FITS headers. This means that the input channels in the MS will be divided evenly into *input_changroups* groups
and each FITS image along the frequency axis will be used to predict visibilities into the appropriate group, regardless of the frequencies in the FITS headers.

Putting all of the above together, a time and frequency varible polarised sky model will consist of a series of FITS files named *txxxx-yyyy-[I,Q,U,V]-model.fits*,
where xxxx=0000, 0001, .... (as many as needed to replicate intrinsic source variability) and yyyy=0000, 0001, .... (must be equal to *input_changroups*).

.. note:: *WSClean* can predict visibilities only into the MODEL_DATA column. MeqSilhouette will copy them into *ms_datacolumn*, after which the signal corruptions are applied only to *ms_datacolumn*. Hence, the uncorrupted visibilities are available in MODEL_DATA column for inspection. If *MeqTrees* is used instead, the uncorrupted visibilities from *ms_datacolumn* are copied to MODEL_DATA.


ASCII / Tigger LSM format
-------------------------
The ASCII / Tigger LSM file with extensions *.txt* / *.lsm.html* respectively, are sky model files recognisable by the *tigger-lsm* module used by *MeqTrees*. This file contains a list of sources, with each row corresponding to one source. The columns are as shown in the figure below:

.. image:: LSM.png
    :width: 764px
    :align: center
    :height: 579px
    :alt: MeqTrees compatible LSM format

.. note:: It is recommended to use FITS images as inputs (in which case *WSClean* is used for predicting visibilities) for EHT simulations. MeqTrees has been observed to occasionally give rise to precision errors of up to ~1 micro-arcsecond. Hence, when using ASCII / Tigger LSM files, additional sanity checks must be performed to ensure that the source positions are not offset from the expected values. This is an outstanding issue with MeqTrees and will be resolved in a future version.

.. _station-info:

Station and site information
############################

The parameter *station_info* points to an ASCII file containing additional information about the
participating stations and the site weather parameters for generating the Jones matrices for corrupting the visibilities.
Each row corresponds to one station. The details of each column are given below.
