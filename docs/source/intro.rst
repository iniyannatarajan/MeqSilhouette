Introduction to MeqSilhouette
=============================

MeqSilhouette is a radio interferometry observation simulator.
`Blecher et al. (2017) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464..143B/abstract>`_ presents an earlier version which could
generate synthetic data and apply corruptions such as scattering by interstellar medium (ISM), atmospheric effects,
and antenna pointing offsets. 
The current version, `Natarajan et al. (2022) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512..490N/abstract>`_, is capable of generating fully polarised, time-variable, spectrally-resolved sky models
and propagation path effects including (but not limited to) instrumental polarisation, updated atmospheric effects and pointing
offsets, time-variable antenna gains, and bandpass effects.

This documentation explains the steps necessary for installing and using MeqSilhouette.
